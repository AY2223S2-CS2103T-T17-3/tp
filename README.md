* The E-Lister is targeted at salesman who want to improve their sales output.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Tag and filter selected users by a specified criteria
  * Export a csv list of contact details
* The project can be used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **E-Lister Product Website (coming soon!)**.
* This project is based on the Elister-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
