### Project: E-Lister

E-Lister is a desktop application used for insurance agents and those of other client-facing professions for managing their contacts.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

These are my contributions to the project.

-   **New Feature**: More convenient commands
    * What it does: allows the user to use shorter commands in place of the entire word. The user can also define their custom shortcuts in place of the default shortcuts.
    * Justification: the feature allows commands to be registered much more quickly. For example, the user can undo multiple actions almost immediately since `u` can be used in place of `undo`.

-   **Enhancements to existing features**:
    -   The user can use the `find` command with a search term that matches a user's name partially.
    -   The user can click on a button to open the window in a new tab instead of copying the URL having opened the help window.


-   **Documentation**: 
    - Developer Guide:
      - Added implementation details of `ShortcutCommand`
    - User Guide:
      - Added documentation of the improved `find` feature, as well as the `shortcut` command.
